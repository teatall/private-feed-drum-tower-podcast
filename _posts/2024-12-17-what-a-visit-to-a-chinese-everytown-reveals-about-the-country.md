Chances are you’ve never heard of Yichun. The city in Jiangxi province in south-western China is home to a bustling night market, a fancy shopping mall and a handful of new skyscrapers. It’s neither big nor small, its residents neither tremendously rich, nor terribly poor.

Indeed, what makes Yichun remarkable is its ordinariness. And that same quality makes it the ideal place to visit if you want to gauge how Chinese people feel about life in their country. From an office in Beijing, China’s ascent from poverty to modernity can be summarised by a dry graph showing a smooth upwards curve. But spend enough time speaking to folks in Yichun and a different picture emerges.

In the first episode of a two-part series, David Rennie, The Economist’s geopolitics editor, and Alice Su, our senior China correspondent, head to Yichun and ask its elderly residents if they are hopeful or fearful about the future.
