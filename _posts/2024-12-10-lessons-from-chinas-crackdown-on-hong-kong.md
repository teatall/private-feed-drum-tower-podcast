Chinese tanks didn’t roll into Hong Kong when it was gripped by huge pro-democracy protests five years ago. Instead, the government bided its time. But when the world’s attention was elsewhere, the punishments began.

From prominent politicians to teenage protesters, scores of people have been jailed for crimes that resemble little more than the ordinary business of democratic politics. Their fate speaks to the crushing power of China’s security state and sends a strong message to places like Taiwan.

This week on “Drum Tower”, Alice Su, The Economist’s senior China correspondent, and David Rennie, our geopolitics editor, ask what we can learn from Beijing’s crackdown on the city, and what it means for the future of Hong Kong.
