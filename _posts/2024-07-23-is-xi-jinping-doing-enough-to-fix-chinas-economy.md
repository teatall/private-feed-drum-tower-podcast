Twice a decade, China’s Communist Party leaders convene at Beijing’s Jingxi Hotel for the “third plenum”, a meeting focused on long-term reforms that has, at times, changed the course of Chinese history. Last week’s plenum took place against a backdrop of economic troubles and growing doubts about Xi Jinping’s ability to address them.
