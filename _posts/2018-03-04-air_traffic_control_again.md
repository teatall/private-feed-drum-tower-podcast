I once commuted between Nanjing and Beijing continuously for 15 months. At the beginning, 4 hours spent on the high
speed train was acceptable. It was after 12 months or so when I stated
to found it intolerable because of the noise and small space. So later I
switched to flights for the trip because the duration in a small space
was shortened for half and, most of all, much quieter. ![The most uncomfortable thing is that they try to keep no transparency
of
information.](/assets/img/56807497-ed40be80-6826-11e9-913a-c745116fc59c.jpg)

My flight to Beijing was delayed again today and there was no
information to the exact time when it was going to take off. Airline
staff at the boarding gate seems very reluctant to tell any further
information except that there was air traffic control on-going. I
managed to get in contact with a friend in the civil aviation industry,
and he told me that the flight was expected to be delayed for 4 hours
because of air traffic control due to some reasons I cannot write down
here.

I sat in the airport not knowing what to do to help except checking
constantly on my phone, hoping to find more information about the
flight. The flight app was still blaming the late arrival of the
previous flight for the delay, yet the previous flight arrive less than
40 minutes late and it had been hours ago.

I could not help recalling the flight I had when I was visiting Europe
in December 2013. My colleagues and I were visiting the Netherlands and
Germany for purchase of equipment. The Airbus A340-300 of Lufthansa took
off on time from Nanjing and arrived in Frankfurt in advance. After EU
border clearance and security check, we arrived at the boarding gate of
our connecting flight to Amsterdam only to find it had been delayed.

I asked Lufthansa staff at the boarding gate, and she told me with a
very comforting voice that they were expecting a 30 minute delay because
of thick fog at Budapest where the aircraft was supposed to fly back
from. I was satisfied because they have provided an exact time about the
delay and I could do nothing but sit and wait to help.

Later the plane with the flying crane logo arrived and passengers from
Budapest got off orderly. Announcement was quickly made to comfort us
that the flight would be delayed for 30 minutes because of the Budapest
fog, and they were really sorry for that. Their engineers were busy
preparing for the next flight so everyone could stay calm and take a bit
more rest. They also hope passengers could have “a really quick
boarding” so that they could take us to Amsterdam as soon as possible.

Soon the gate opened and we indeed had “a really quick boarding”.

When we landed at Amsterdam, Schiphol Airport was also in a mist. Yet we
were indeed only 30 minutes late.
