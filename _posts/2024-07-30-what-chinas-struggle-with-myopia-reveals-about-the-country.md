For decades, rates of myopia have surged among Chinese children. Today, more than half of Chinese youngsters are short-sighted, with rates rising to 80% among high-school graduates. Scientists believe that intense schooling and a lack of time spent outdoors may be to blame. Now, China’s covid lockdowns have inadvertently provided scientists with further evidence that confirms that theory. So why is it so difficult to persuade parents to encourage kids to play outdoors?

David Rennie, The Economist’s Beijing bureau chief, and Rosie Blau, co-host of “The Intelligence” podcast, examine why short-sightedness is a major problem facing China, and how scientists and public-health officials are trying to tackle it. They ask: what does China’s struggle with myopia reveal about life in the country?
