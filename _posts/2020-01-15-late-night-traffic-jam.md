I was taking a taxi to go back to my place in the late night after a long day. The ride was smooth as silk until we were approaching a school. I was trapped in a traffic congestion, and so was I in the previous night.

Outside the car was a giant and messy 'parking lot' -- one right on a four-lane road. By 'four-lane' I mean those in the direction of my travel, as clearly there were another four in the opposite direction. In those cars were anxious parents waiting to pick up their children who were just off night sessions of schooling or self-study. As schools don't have parking places for these cars, parents were just parking in the road which literally took up all the lanes to block all traffic. It was really annoying to witness this again as I could not recall how many times had I been trapped in such congestions in front of schools of Nanjing, and I could not help complaining to the driver how irresponsible such actions were.

> \- They need to install more cameras in front of schools for traffic enforcement.

The driver replied, who seemed not happy with the situation, but pretty contented with his solution.

I was amused. How many more cameras and how much more coercion do we need in this country?
