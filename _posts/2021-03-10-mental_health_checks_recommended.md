I had to witness this weird conversation on Twitter. I think it would look absolutely weird to any normal person even if I'm not providing any context.

It would be like this if we simplify it and put it into plain daily conversation:

> \- You guys are doing this wrong.
> 
> \- My family is much richer than yours! Itâ€™s no longer 30 yrs ago!

You might be really confused by now. If so, please take a look at the pictures I have made.

Therefore, I fully agree with [Bai Erqiang's point](https://blog.dastle.net/2020/02/18/state-media-in-covid19) about regular health checks, in particular mental health checks.
