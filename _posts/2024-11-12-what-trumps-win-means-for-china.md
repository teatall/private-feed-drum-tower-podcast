For evidence that America is a corrupt and broken country run by billionaires, look no further than the re-election of Donald Trump—at least that’s how Chinese propagandists are spinning it. In their hands, Mr Trump’s victory is proof of their superpower rival’s decline.

But what will be the real-world consequences of Mr Trump’s return to power? The 60% tariffs he’s threatened would be a serious challenge for China’s economy. And a confrontation over Taiwan would be disastrous for the world.

When it comes to China, will Mr Trump listen to the superhawks in his next administration? Or could he strike a deal with China? David Rennie, The Economist’s geopolitics editor, and Alice Su, our senior China correspondent, ask what Mr Trump’s return to the White House will mean for the country.
