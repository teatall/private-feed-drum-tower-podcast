I went to San Francisco to see a friend in September 2015. It was my
first time to the United States and I decided to arrive in advance for a
visit to Los Angeles to see the Hollywood and
Universal Studios. I took B-2033, a Boeing 777-300er of Air China (you
guys will not understand the stupidity of an aviation enthusiast). My
arrival at the Los Angeles International Airport was after 5 PM. After
border clearance and luggage pickup, it was too late to go any where so
I took a taxi to my hotel to have some sleep.![I liked the blue sky in particular.](/assets/img/67599985-09fe7600-f726-11e9-990c-ba10f5c18c20.jpg)

I got up early in the next morning for my trip. According to many online
travel guides, I was traveling around by the public transport system of
Los Angeles. Google Maps told me that I need to first take bus to a
certain stop and transfer to metro to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Quickly I found the bus stop. It was, compared to bus stops of my
country, quite a shabby one, to be frank. There was only a pole with a
number of plates attached, with information of stops and departure time.
To my surprise, the bus arrived exactly as scheduled.

Thanks to the omnipotent internet, I was planning to buy a day pass. The
day pass of the public transport system of Los Angeles costs 5 dollars
but you will need to first get a TAP card which costs another 2 dollars.
With a day pass you can have as many rides as you would like to within
24 hours. So I asked the driver of the bus as soon as I got on the bus.

> – Can I have a day pass please?
>
> – I am sorry. We don’t have any TAP cards left on this bus.

Fine, my plan of saving money went bankrupt.

> – All right, shall I have a ticket to \*\*\* station? How much is
> that?
>
> – Are you transferring to the metro there?
>
> – Yes, I am.
>
> – That’s not necessary. You can get your day pass at the metro
> station.

I was a bit surprised to hear that and went backwards to have a seat —
it was so nice to be trusted.
