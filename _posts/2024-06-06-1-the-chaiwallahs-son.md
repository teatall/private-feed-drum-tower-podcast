Born in a small town in Gujarat, Narendra Modi is looking for a way to escape. He finds it in the Hindu-nationalist RSS

Narendra Modi has been chosen to lead India for the third time in a row. But after ten years in power, he was humbled at the national election. What kind of leader will he be? Stories from his youth in the Hindu-nationalist movement offer clues.

This episode draws on audio from the following publishers: Narendra Modi YouTube, ANI, Legend Global Studios, Lalit Vachani, Prasar Bharti Archives, Desh Gujarat, The New York Times, NDTV, Doordarshan and BBC.
