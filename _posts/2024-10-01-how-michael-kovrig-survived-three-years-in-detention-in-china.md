Michael Kovrig spent his first six months at the Dahongmen detention centre in solitary confinement. Inside his padded, windowless cell, the lights were never turned off. They would stay on for the next three years.

The former Canadian diplomat quickly realised that survival demanded a strict physical and mental regime. He would need it. 1,019 days passed before the political game that put Mr Kovrig in Dahongmen was resolved.

In the second episode of a two-part series, David Rennie, The Economistâ€™s geopolitics editor, speaks with Mr Kovrig about how he survived inside a machine designed to crush the human spirit.
