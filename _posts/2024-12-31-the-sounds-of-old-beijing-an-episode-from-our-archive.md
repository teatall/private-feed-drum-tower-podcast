Our weekly podcast on China. This week we select one of our favourite shows from 2024: a sonic journey through imperial Beijing

David Rennie, The Economist’s geopolitics editor, and Alice Su, our senior China correspondent, discuss what they’re looking out for in China in 2025, before Alice selects one of her favourite episodes of Drum Tower in 2024 to replay for the end of the year: the sounds of old Beijing.

In some ways, Beijing now sounds like a lot of other mega cities. Yet, back in imperial times, sound was used in creative ways to display wealth, to conduct everyday business and, most importantly, to keep order. David Rennie takes us once again on a sonic journey through the places where Beijing’s ancient soundscape is being kept alive. He meets Colin Chinnery, a sound artist and archivist, to find out why sound has long been a vital part of Beijing’s spirit, and the ways in which it still is today.
