I was in Germany back in December 2013 for a contract of equipment. We
were heading back to Munich by car because
our flight back to Shanghai was departing on the second day. It was just
before Christmas so the celebratory atmosphere was obvious, and traffic
on the express way was really heavy. ![The Christmas tree in front of

I was a bit surprised when the driver slowed down and stopped. The
German express ways did not have any upper limit for speed so we were
actually going pretty fast before running into this traffic jam ahead of
us. It was a dual-lane way and there was an additional emergency lane on
the right.

The driver told us that it might be a traffic accident blocking
everyone. We were greatly discouraged because we really wanted to go
back to hotel quickly for some rest after a long day. It seemed he
sensed our dismay and comforted us that the congestion would not be
long.

Soon came the ambulance siren from the back and all of the sudden cars
including ours started to move and scatter towards both sides of the
way. Quickly a narrow passage was made for clearance of the ambulance
and still NO ONE was taking the emergency lane.

Soon recovered the traffic and we were only like 20 minutes late.
