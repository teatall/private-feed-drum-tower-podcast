Hefei is an inland city only a few hours by train from Shanghai. But while teenagers in the coastal megacity attend voguing parties and young men wear makeup to work, growing up in conservative Hefei is different.

Failing to conform to your parents’ expectations of what it means to be a good child can lead to trouble. In Zhang Enxu’s case, that meant years of beatings and, when those didn’t work, being sent to a disciplinary centre to be “fixed”.

These private, often expensive, centres are a final resort for parents. Their admission criteria are wide: anything from performing poorly at school to having a different sexual orientation. And life on the inside can be brutal.

Alice Su, The Economist’s senior China correspondent, and Don Weinland, our China business and finance editor, meet Zhang and find out what happens when young Chinese challenge the social conservatism of their parents.
