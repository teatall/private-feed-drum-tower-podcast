I was visiting San Francisco in September 2015 to see a friend and paid
a visit to Los Angeles before that.

My flight was leaving on the next morning so I planed to have some nice
local food in the previous evening. I had an awesome day in Universal
Studios, and thanks to the jet lag, I fell asleep on the metro. As a
result I missed my stop and did not wake up until the metro took me to
Union Station, the last stop.

All right, let me find a restaurant around now that I have been at the
station. I went out the station and managed to Yelped a popular
restaurant which served local food.

might be still too early for dinner so there were not too many guests. A
beautiful waitress greeted me and took me to a table next to the window.

I looked at the menu, and ordered salad and roasted pork with honey.
Since there was only one kind of soup available on that day, I ordered
that as well.

My food was quickly ready and served. The food was in big proportion and
looked really nice too. I took a bite of the pork, and it was soft,
juicy and sweet. Salad on the side was also fresh. I could smell the
aroma of the vegetable. Yet the soup was really not something I like. I
was not able to tell what was it made from. It was green so I figured it
might be shred spinach. It was totally different from what I had
expected, and to the great surprise of mine, it was cold. I took a sip
and decided to leave it alone.

When I was about to finish, the waitress walked up.

> – No. I thought it was some hot soup. Could you heat it for me?
>
> – No, it is meant to be served cold and it is our special dish today.

I figured I should just leave it alone since I was really enjoying the
pork.

> – You don’t like the soup, do you? I can return it if you don’t like

>
> – Oh really? That would be very nice!

So she returned the soup for me.
