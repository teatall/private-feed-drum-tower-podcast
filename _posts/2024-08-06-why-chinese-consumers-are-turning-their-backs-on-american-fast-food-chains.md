American fast food was once a symbol of modernity in China. Pop songs were sung in honour of McDonald’s and families flocked to its restaurants. So why are a growing number of Chinese now favouring local brands?

Rosie Blau, co-host of “The Intelligence” podcast and Don Weinland, our China business and finance correspondent, discuss a potted history of American fast food in China and ask: what does the country’s changing appetite reveal about China today?

This episode features a short extract of “Story of the Spring”, written by Jiang Kairu and Ye Xuquan, composed by Wang Yougui and performed by Dong Wenhua.
