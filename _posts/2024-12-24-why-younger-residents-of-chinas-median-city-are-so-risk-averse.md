Our weekly podcast on China. In the second episode of a two-part series, we meet young inhabitants of Yichun, a Chinese everytown

Spare a thought for China’s youngsters. Unlike their parents, who came of age at a time when it wasn’t hard to catch a ride on China’s economic elevator, young Chinese have fewer opportunities. Despite hard work and university degrees, many are priced out of the property market. In a country where having an apartment is generally a prerequisite for marriage, and bride prices can demolish a family’s savings, that institution is increasingly out of reach.

The result is a generation of people who are risk-averse, which becomes clear when you talk with people in Yichun, China’s “median city”.

In the second episode of a two-part series, David Rennie, The Economist’s geopolitics editor, and Alice Su, our senior China correspondent, return to Yichun to ask its younger residents if they are hopeful or fearful about the future.
