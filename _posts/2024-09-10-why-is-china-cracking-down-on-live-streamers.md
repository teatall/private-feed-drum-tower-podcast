Live-streaming is big business in China, with millions of broadcasts happening daily, featuring everything from shopping deals to dating advice. This digital gold rush has lifted many out of poverty and made others wealthy, but it comes with risks. In a country where censorship is pervasive, streamers must toe the line on socialist values—or face being shut down.

Jiehao Chen, The Economist’s China researcher and “Drum Tower” producer, hosts this episode with Ted Plafker, our China correspondent in Beijing. Together they ask: what’s life like inside this dynamic but precarious world, and what does the increasing censorship of live-streamers for flaunting wealth say about China today?
