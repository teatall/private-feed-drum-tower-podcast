Dastle – the word
-----------------

Dastle is a word of my own creation back in college. It means **D**avid’s C**astle**.

I have been using this word on many occasions ever since. For example,
my wifi in my room is called Dastle.

Dastle – the blog
-----------------

The blog was started when I first entered college in 2005. It was kept on
and off until 2011 when I graduated from college with my master’s
degree.

In 2012, I started my first official job. It was at that time when
mico-blogs such as Twitter/Weibo started to dominate and blogs started
to die out, so did mine.

Starting again
--------------

Since I started my first official job in 2012, I have been experiencing
and gaining much, and thus began to comprehend the world deeper yet I
was not able to write down all the stories.

I was very lucky to have had a conversation on 25 Fed., 2018 with my
tutor back in college. I think it was the third time that she encouraged
me to write down all my stories. I had planned to start a subscription
account on WeChat but refrained from that for my concern about my
private information at the disposal of Tecent if I did that. So voila, I
re-started this blog.

Something not so related – I think 25 Fed., 2018 is also a very
important date for my fellow countrymen.

On 28 Feb., 2018, the blog was finally on again. I was also very happy
to have retrieved backups of my blog from my beloved IBM Thinkpad X40.
When the recovery was done and I was going through all previous posts,
somewhere soft and deep down in my heart was poked – it’s so good to see
something written years ago.

I will continue to write down stories.

Theme of the foreground
-----------------------

I found this theme, b4st, from [this
page](https://github.com/SimonPadbury/b4st) on Github. It was made by
Simon Padbury based on Bootstrap 4. Some modifications were done
according to personal preference of mine.
